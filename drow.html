        <p>As means of communication.
            As the idea becomes technical the usual means of communication (talk or listen, read or write) will be less exact. For this reason visual language is developed to be technical and accurate means communication. This visual language in broad term is called graphic language. 
            As an engineering drawing displays the exact picture of an object, it obviously conveys the same ideas to every trained eye. Irrespective of language barriers, the drawings can be effectively used in other countries,
            Thus, the engineering drawing is the universal language of all engineers.
            </p>
            <p>Composition of Graphic Language
                Graphic language in  “engineering application”   use lines  to represent the surfaces,  edges  and contours of objects.
                This language is known as  “drawing”  or  “drafting”
                A drawing can be done by freehand,  or using instruments or computer  methods.
                </p>
                <p>There are two principles in drawing
                    Visualization
                          The ability to see what an object looks like in the mind of eye.
                    Implementation
                           Drawing of an object that has been visualized. 
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>Technical drawing must communicate the same message to every user or reader of the drawing, whereas an artistic drawing is usually interpreted differently by everyone who sees it. 
                        Engineers: People who use technical means to solve problems. They design products, systems, devices, and structures to improve our living conditions. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Drawing is one of the oldest forms of communication, dating back even further than the verbal communication.
                            Historically drawing is started by the caveman.
                            He uses it for communication to lead his day to day life.
                            Egyptian hieroglyphics also play its own role for the development of drawing. 
                             Leonardo da Vinci prepared mechanical drawings showing orthographic views as we do now.

                            </p>
                            <p>As human needs increase continuously, there is revolutionary change. Industrial revolution is one of the milestones for the development of drawing. 
                                From time to time several rules and principles are developed to utilize drawing as efficient as possible. 
                                It is about 1749 that, the drawing with the current conventional representations came into existence by Washington DC civil engineers.

                                <p>Sketch: made without drawing tools... Just pencil and paper.  Scale is approximate, not accurate, but the sketch should still look like the object.





                                    Engineering Drawing: Made with drawing tools... Ruler, set squares, protractor and compass.  Scale should be accurate and the drawing should be prepared carefully</p>
