            <p>5. __________________________________________________________________
                Note: A sentence is a meaningful group of words with a period, exclamation point, or
                question mark at the end. However, no definition of the sentence is likely to help you
                much in writing one. You learn sentence structures by speaking, listening, reading and
                writing, more than by studying types of sentences. A sentence has two parts: subject and
                predicate.
                A. The subject of a sentence is what you make a statement or ask a question about.
                This is usually a noun, or a pronoun like she, he or who; but on occasion the
                subject can be something else that substitutes for a noun, like a clause or a phrase.
                Even a verb can be a subject. In the sentence “Is" is a verb” the verb "Is" is the
                subject of this sentence. In the following two sentences, the subjects are marked
                in bold.
                1. The woman in the blue house by the river wrote unusual sentences on the walls.
                2. The weather condition of Adama town is very comfortable during summer.
                B. The predicate is the verb with its modifiers and complements. The predicate is what
                the sentence says about the subject, most often, it is the action that goes on in the
                sentence. In the following two sentences the simple predicates are written in bold:
                1. The frogman dived
                2. The theory was valid
                1.4 Types of Sentences
                Brainstorming questions
                Take five minutes to discuss the following questions
                1. What does a clause mean? What are the two types of clauses in
                English?
                2. What is a simple sentence?
                3. What are compound, complex and compound complex sentences?
                3
                </p>
                <p>Exercise 3
                    Sort the following sentences into simple, compound, complex and compound complex
                    sentences.
                    1. My father wrote me a letter last
                    week.____________________________
                    2. The university guard shouted at the student
                    angrily._______________
                    3. They fished all day; they didn’t catch
                    anything.____________________
                    4. I would like to read a lot; however, I have no time.
                    _________________
                    5. The dog that he saw ran away.________________________
                    6. The dog that he saw in the village run away as the big dog
                    chased it.__________________
                    7. The scientist knew that her experiment would succeeded but she
                    avoided publicity until the final test was completed._____________
                    8. The young girl jumped under the covers when her uncle walked
                    in wearing his gorilla suit, and she refused to come
                    out.______________  <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/914314344/photo/young-woman-taking-an-exam-writing-at-desk-in-classroom.webp?b=1&s=170667a&w=0&k=20&c=jyIvzSPovHdDdqzCgz-6kQO8GH0f7AgSgdY302HE9V0=" alt="">
                    Note that sentences are structurally classified into four types: simple, compound,
                    complex, and compound-complex.
                    A. Simple Sentences
                    A sentence is “Simple” as long as it contains one independent clause. For example, “Jote
                    laughed” is a simple sentence. You can add modifiers like “Big Jote laughed loudly,” or a
                    prepositional phrase, “Jote laughed at her”, and the sentence still remains simple.
                    4
                    </p>
                    <p>As opposed to simple sentence which has one clause, a compound sentence has two or
                        more independent clauses, each containing a subject and a predicate, each describing an
                        action complete in itself. The clauses in the compound sentence are joined by
                        connectives, and but, or, nor, yet, or by a semicolon (;).
                        e.g. The economy develops but prices rise.
                        They can lower the price of admission or they can stage fewer
                        plays.
                        Note that in the above compound sentences the two clauses in each sentence ("The
                        economy develops" and "Prices rise") are equal in importance, or coordinate.
                        C. Complex Sentence
                        Exercise 5
                        A.
                        Read the following Sentences carefully and tell how they
                        are different from simple or compound sentences discussed
                        above.
                        1. The construction industry is growing fast although there is
                        shortage of construction materials.
                        2. I was playing chase when my friend arrived with his leg
                        bleeding.
                        3. The walls which were plastered with dirt had an unpleasant
                        smell.
                        B. Write complex sentences by completing following half
                        sentences.
                        1. When I arrived at Adama University for the first
                        time,_________________________
                        2. Many freshman students study hard
                        although________________________________
                        6
                        </p>
                        <p>. Before I came to Adama
                            University_________________________________________
                            4. __________________________________ as long as I study hard.
                            5. While I was reading in the
                            library___________________________________________C. Construct five similar sentences about what you saw or did
                            since you arrived in Adama University.
                            You have a complex rather than a compound sentence if one part of the sentences
                            depends on the other.. The clause that depends upon the other for explanation or
                            completion is called the subordinate clause/dependent clause. Although the economy
                            develops, high prices find few buyers. In short Complex Sentences consist of one
                            independent clause (IC) and at least one dependent clause (DC). However, the complex
                            sentence provides further variety and allows you to emphasize the relationship of ideas to
                            others in the same sentence. Complex sentences make a precise relationship among ideas.
                            Clauses introduced by such relative pronouns as that, which, or who (sometimes called
                            relative clauses are usually subordinate to a main clause; they depend on it and help to
                            form complex sentences.
                            Examples
                            1. Does she remember the face of the woman who sold her this bracelet?
                            2. The king executed the horse that had thrown him.
                            Other conjunctions like although, even though, after, if, since, and when can introduce
                            subordinate clauses. However each of these conjunctions has its own precise meaning.
                            So the writers need to use each of them carefully.
                            D. Compound-Complex Sentences
                            1. So far you studied simple, compound and complex sentences, what
                            do you guess are compound complex sentences? Discuss your
                            answers with your friends.
                            Exercise 6
                            7
                            <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1288092444/photo/student-using-laptop-having-online-class-with-teacher.webp?b=1&s=170667a&w=0&k=20&c=_25eX3Uwf2PvrTaarBWWekKO8WvZGqvS3jQVVdjRKRA=" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <p>A.
                                Identify the main and the subordinate clauses in the
                                following sentences and say whether they are compound
                                complex or not.
                                1. The police strike lasted a week, but no robberies occurred in that time.
                                2. Stamp collecting is fascinating bobby that may also be profitable.
                                3. Doctors are studying the diet that aggravates cancer and they hope to discover some
                                link between diet and cancer.
                                4. We submitted our calculations, and we included several drawings even though both
                                types of information were not required.
                                5. Even though the data were unavailable until Thursday, Stan collated what he had,
                                and he submitted the report on Tuesday.
                                B. Construct compound-complex sentences by using the following sentence
                                starters.
                                1. Dormitory life is good but________________________________________

                                C. Construct five compound complex sentences of your own as homework.
                                Note that, in compound complex sentences, there are at least two main clauses and one
                                subordinate clause. Hence, sometimes you can use the combination of compound and
                                complex sentences in your writing.
                                Exercise 7
                                8
                                </p>
                                <p>A.
                                    Combine each of the following groups of simple
                                    sentences to produce the kind of sentence specified in
                                    parentheses. You will have to add, delete, change, and
                                    rearrange words.
                                    Example: The traffic passed her house. It never stopped. (Complex)
                                    The traffic that passed her house never stopped.
                                    1. Dinner was tasty. It did not fill us up. (Compound)
                                    2. The storm was predicted to be fierce. It passed by quickly. (Complex)
                                    3. The musical notes died away. Then a strange object filled the sky (Complex)
                                    4. The wolves were afraid. They feared the fire. (Simple)
                                    5. We wanted the rumors to stop. We hoped for that. They did not
                                    (Compound-Complex).
