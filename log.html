    <p>CHAPTER ONE BASIC CONCEPTS OF LOGIC </p>
    <p>Lesson 1: Basic Concepts of Logic:

        Arguments, 
        Premises and 
        Conclusions 
        The word logic comes from Greek word logos, which means sentence, discourse, reason, truth and rule. 
        Logic in its broader meaning is the science, 
        Which evaluates arguments and 
        The study of methods and principles of correct reasoning or the art of correct reasoning
        
        </p>
        <p>Logic can be defined in different ways. Here below are some definitions of logic: 
            Logic is a science that evaluates arguments.  
            Logic is a science that helps to develop the method and principles that we may use as a criterion for evaluating the arguments of others and as a guide to construct good arguments of our own. 
            Logic is the attempt to codify the rules of rational thought. 
            Logicians explore the structure of arguments that preserve truth or allow the optimal extraction of knowledge from evidence. 
            </p>
            <p>In logic, as an academic discipline, we study
                Reasoning itself 
                Forms of argument, 
                General principles and particular errors, along with methods of arguing. 
                We see lots of mistakes in reasoning in daily life and logic can help us understand what is wrong or why someone is arguing in a particular way. 
                What is the Benefit of Studying Logic?
                Logic sharpens and refines our natural gifts to think, reason and argue.  
                We use logic in our day-to-day communications
                </p>
                <p>It helps us to develop the skill needed to construct sound (good) and fallacy-free    arguments of one‘s own and to evaluate the arguments of others; 
                    It provides a fundamental defense against the prejudiced and uncivilized attitudes that threaten the foundation of a civilized and democratic society; 
                    It helps us to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments; 
                    It helps us to understand and identify the common logical errors in reasoning;  
                    It helps us to understand and identify the common confusions that often happen due to misuse of language; 
                    </p>
                    <p>It enables us to disclose ill-conceived policies in the political sphere, to be careful of disguises, and to distinguish the rational from irrational and the sane from the insane and so on. 
                        In fact, one of the goals of logic is to produce individuals who are critical, rational and reasonable both in the sphere of public and private life. 
                    However, to be full beneficial of the worth which logic provides, one must thoroughly and carefully understand the basic concepts of the subject and be able to apply them in the actual situations</p>

                        However, to be full beneficial of the worth which logic provides, one must thoroughly and carefully understand the basic concepts of the subject and be able to apply them in the actual situations
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us examine the features of this definition in detail. 
                            First, an argument is a group of statements. That is, the first requirement for a passage to be qualified as an argument is to combine two or more statements. But, what is a statement? 
                            A statement is a declarative sentence that has a truth-value of either true or false. 
                            That is, statement is a sentence that has truth-value. 
                            Hence, truth and falsity are the two possible truth values of a statement. A statement is typically a declarative sentence. 
                            In other words, statement is a type of sentence that could stand as a declarative sentence. 
                            Look the following examples: 
                            Dr. Abiy Ahmed the current Prime Minister of Ethiopia. 
                            Mekelle is the capital city of Tigray Region.  
                            Ethiopia was colonized by Germany. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Statement (a) and (b) are true, because they describe things as they are, or assert what really is the case. Hence, “Truth‟ is their truth-value. 
                                Whereas statement (c) is false because it asserts what is not, and “Falsity‟ its truth-value. 
                                N.B: Logicians used proposition and statement interchangeably. 
                                However, in strict (technical) sense, proposition is the meaning or information content of a statement. 
                                In this chapter, the term statement is used to refer premises and a conclusion. 
                                However, there are sentences that are not statements, and hence should be used to construct an argument. 
                                Examples: 
                                Would you close the window? (Question)  
                                Let us study together. (Proposal) 
                                Right on! (Exclamation)  
                                I suggest that you read philosophy texts. (Suggestion) 
                                Give me your ID Card, Now! (Command) 
                                </p>
                                <p>In fact, sentence is a group of words or phrases that enables us to express ideas or thought meaningfully. 
                                    However, unlike statements, none of the above sentences can be either true or false. 
                                    Hence, none of them can be classified as statement and can’t make up an argument
                                    Second, the statements that make up an argument are divided into premise(s) and conclusion. 
                                    However, a passage contains two or more statements cannot guarantee  the existence of an argument. 
                                    Hence, an argument is a group statement, which contains at least one premise and one and only one conclusion. 
                                    This definition makes it clear that an argument may contain more than one premise but only one conclusion. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Argument always attempts to justify a claim. 
                                        The claim that the statement attempts to justify is known as a conclusion of an argument; and 
                                        The statement (s) that supposedly justify the claim is/are known as the premises of the argument. 
                                        Therefore, a premise is a statement that set forth the reason or evidence. It is claimed evidence; 
                                        Conclusion is a statement, which is claimed to follow from the given evidence (premise). 
                                        In other words, the conclusion is the claim that an argument is trying to establish.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Let us now construct arguments together. 
                                            Example-1:                                                                                       
                                            All Ethiopians are Africans. (Premise 1) 
                                            Tsionawit is Ethiopian. (Premise2) 
                                            Therefore, Tsionawit is African. (Conclusion) 
                                            Example-2:  
                                            Some Africans are black. (Premise-1) 
                                            Zelalem is an African. (Premise-2) 
                                            Therefore, Zelalem is black. (Conclusion)
                                            The claim that the premises support the conclusion, (and/or that the conclusion follow from the premises), is indicated by the word “therefore.‘‘ 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>All arguments may be placed in one of two basic groups: 
                                                Those in which the premises really do support the conclusion -are said to be good (well-supported) arguments
                                                Those in which they do not, even though they are claimed to- are said to be bad (poorly-supported) arguments. 
                                                For example, in the first argument, the premises really do support the conclusion, they give good reason for believing that the conclusion is true, and therefore, the argument is a good one. 
                                                But the premises of the second argument fail to support the conclusion adequately. 
                                                Even if they may be true, they do not provide good reason to believe that the conclusion is true. 
                                                Therefore, it is bad argument, but it is still an argument. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>How can we distinguish premises from conclusion and vice versa? 
                                                    One of the most important tasks  of Logic in the analysis of arguments is to distinguish premises from conclusion and vice versa.   
                                                    Since it is impossible to analyze arguments without identifying a conclusion from premises, we need techniques that can help us to identify premises from a conclusion and vice versa. 
                                                    The first technique is to looking at an indicator word. 
                                                    Frequently, arguments contain certain indicator words that provide clues in identifying premises and conclusion. 
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>Here below are some Conclusion Indicators: 
                                                        Therefore 	Wherefore 		Accordingly 
                                                        Provided that 	It must be that 	We may conclude 
                                                        Entails that 	Hence 		It shows that 
                                                        Whence 		Thus 			Consequently 
                                                        We may infer 	It implies that 	As a result 
                                                        So 			It follows that
                                                  In an argument that contains any of these indicator words, the statement that follows these words can usually be identified as the conclusion. 
                                                  By the process of elimination, the other statements in the argument can be identified as premises, but only based on their logical importance to the identified conclusion. 
                                                   Example: 
                                                  Women are mammals. 
                                                  Zenebech is a woman. 
                                                  Therefore, Zenebech is a mammal.  
                                                  </p>
                                                  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1446511437394-36cdff3ae1b3?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTR8fGxvZ2ljJTIwYW5kJTIwa3JpdGljYWwlMjB0aGlua2luZyUyMGNvdXJzZSUyMGltYWdlJTIwYmFja2dyaXViZHxlbnwwfHwwfHx8MA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=60" alt="">
                                                  <p>If an argument does not contain a conclusion indicator, it may contain a premise indicator. Some  typical Premise Indicators: 
                                                    Since     from   As        indicated by 	   Because          Owing to
                                                     Seeing that 	           Given that           As       For 	            In that 
                                                    May be inferred          In as much as          For the reason that
                                               In an argument, a statement that follows these indicator words can usually be identified as a premise. 
                                               By same the process of elimination, the other remaining single statement will be a conclusion. 
                                               Example: You should avoid any form of cheating on exams, because, cheating on exams is punishable by the Senate Legislation of the University. 
                                               The word “for this reason‘‘  is special in that it comes immediately after the premise it indicates and before the conclusion. 
                                               This indicator can be both premise and conclusion indicator</p>
